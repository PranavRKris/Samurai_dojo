Its a simple html, canvas code for an animated character who does different actions depending on user input

Thanks for checking out my first project.

For controlling the character use the arrow keys and use the spacebar to perform a block,
and for some dynamics i added a size variable that will increase the width while moving forward 
and vice versa, this kind of gives us the illusion of the character moving.
